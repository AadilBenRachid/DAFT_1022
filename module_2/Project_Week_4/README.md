# Mini-Project | Module 2 Cumulative Lab 1

## Introduction
The goal of this extended lab is to apply the statistical concepts that you have learned so far to real-world data both to practice and better understand how these concepts are useful.

## Getting Started

This lab consists of two parts: Data cleaning & Exploratory data analysis. 
You should begin with '1.-Data Cleaning.ipynb', and then move on to '2.-EDA.ipynb' as you will want to use the clean dataset you build in part 1 to complete part 2.

## Expectations

   1. Write clean, well-commented code
   
   2. Fully explain your responses where necessary
   
   3. Refer to the lecture notes if you have questions
   
   4. Don't be afraid to ask your TAs for help!
   

## Deliverables

* '1.-Data Cleaning.ipynb' with your responses
* '2.-EDA.ipynb' with your responses

## Submission

Upon completion, add your deliverables to git. Then commit git and push your branch to the remote.
